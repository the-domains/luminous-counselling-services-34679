            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/af322320-5474-44ff-bbca-acf8abdc9a78.png" title="Rod Minaker MA (Counselling/Psychology)">,<p>Since 2007, I have been counselling individuals, couples, families, and therapy groups as a Masters-trained therapist. Rod specializes in <em><strong>helping people have preferred relationships with themselves and others </strong></em>utilizing the following modalities:</p>,<ul><li>Narrative Therapy</li><li>CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy)</li><li>Coherence Therapy (Direct Brief Oriented Therapy)</li><li>Collaborative Couples therapy</li><li>Gottman Couples Therapy Method</li><li>EFT (Emotion Focused Therapy)</li><li>Internal Family Systems Therapy</li><li>Contextual Family Therapy</li></ul>,<p>Each one of these modalities were carefully chosen to aid clients in making their relationships with oneself and each other a place of trust, respect, and lasting connection.</p>,<p>Therapy groups are not only a powerful way to learn, practice, and get feedback on how we come across to others; these groups can amplify what we take away from the experience both in our relationships with ourselves and others. I have, thus, developed and facilitate group therapy programs for the following counselling concerns:</p>,<ul><li>Anger Management</li><li>Resentment Release Therapy</li><li>Domestic Violence Offender Therapy</li></ul>,<p>My passion for the work of therapy comes from the core belief that each person has a preferred way to relate to those who they get their emotional needs from. It is a distinct privilege of mine to help my clients navigate through intense emotional truths in a straightforward and sensitive way to help them express the care they have for those that matter to them.</p>]]></description>
