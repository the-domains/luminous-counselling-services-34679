Since 2007, I have been counselling individuals, couples, families, and therapy groups as a Masters-trained therapist. I am passionate about _**helping people have preferred relationships with themselves and others **_utilizing the following modalities:

* Narrative Therapy
* CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy)
* Coherence Therapy (Direct Brief Oriented Therapy)
* Collaborative Couples therapy
* Gottman Couples Therapy Method
* EFT (Emotion Focused Therapy)
* Internal Family Systems Therapy
* Contextual Family Therapy

Each one of these modalities were carefully chosen to aid clients in making their relationships with oneself and each other a place of trust, respect, and lasting connection. As such, the following are counselling concerns we can effectively and efficiently create desired changes together:

Therapy groups are not only a powerful way to learn, practice, and get feedback on how we come across to others; these groups can amplify what we take away from the experience both in our relationships with ourselves and others. I have, thus, developed and facilitate group therapy programs for the following counselling concerns:

* Anger Management
* Resentment Release Therapy
* Domestic Violence Offender Therapy

My passion for the work of therapy comes from the core belief that each person has a preferred way to relate to those who they get their emotional needs from. It is a distinct privilege of mine to help my clients navigate through intense emotional truths in a straightforward and sensitive way to help them express the care they have for those that matter to them.
