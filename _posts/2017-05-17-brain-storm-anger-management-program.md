  Storms are a fact of life! Yet, these storms can be potentially destructive -
  whether we are talking about severe weather or the storm we can experience
  within! Anger storms the brain loosening our connection to our lived
  experience/wisdom, our moral reasoning, our compassion for others, and our
  compassion to ourselves. Like severe weather, the key to being prepared for an
  emotional storm of intense anger is early detection! Brain Storm Anger
  Management therapy program offers the most current evidence-based skills and
  strategies to help manage and calm this emotional intensity within. When we
  are more aware of and able to quiet this inner experience, we will be able to
  assert ourselves in more constructive rather than destructive ways.
